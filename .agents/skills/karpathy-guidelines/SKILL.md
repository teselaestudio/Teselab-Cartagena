# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution and simplicity over speed or speculative overengineering.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what is confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No complex build pipelines when native browser ES modules suffice.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless requested.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Maintain existing documentation integrity.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Transform tasks into clear, verifiable success criteria.**

- Know exactly what "done" looks like before writing code.
- Verify each change step-by-step.
